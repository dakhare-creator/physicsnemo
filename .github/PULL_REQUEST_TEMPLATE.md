## Review Process

**All PRs are reviewed by the PhysicsNeMo team before merging.**

Depending on which files are changed, GitHub may automatically assign a maintainer for review.

We are also testing AI-based code review tools (e.g., Greptile), which may add automated comments with a confidence score.
This score reflects the AI‚Äôs assessment of merge readiness and is **not** a qualitative judgment of your work, nor is
it an indication that the PR will be accepted / rejected.

AI-generated feedback should be reviewed critically for usefulness.
You are not required to respond to every AI comment, but they are intended to help both authors and reviewers.
Please react to Greptile comments with üëç or üëé to provide feedback on their accuracy.
